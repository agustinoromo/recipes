Sloppy Joe Quesadilla

Ingredients:
1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 c. ketchup
1/3 c. brown sugar
2 tbsp. mustard
1 tbsp. chili powder
kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 medium flour tortillas
1 c. shredded Cheddar
1 c. Shredded Monterey Jack

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil and cook onions until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ground beef and cook until no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain fat.
Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and chili powder and season generously with salt and pepper. Simmer until thick, 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a plate and clean skillet.
Over medium-high heat, add a flour tortilla to the skillet. Top with ground beef mixture then sprinkle with cheddar and Monterey Jack. Place a second tortilla on top. Cook until the bottom tortilla is golden, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook until the second tortilla is golden and the cheese has melted, about 2 more minutes.
Repeat with remaining ingredients. Slice into wedges and serve warm.
